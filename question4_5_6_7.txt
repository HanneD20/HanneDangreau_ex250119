Question 4:
-----------

Question 5:
-----------
SELECT gene_name, count(*) AS total_transcripts FROM gene JOIN transcript ON gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id GROUP BY gene_name ORDER BY total_transcripts DESC LIMIT 1;

Question 6:
-----------
SELECT chromosome, count(*) AS total_genes FROM gene WHERE description LIKE "%CANCER%" GROUP BY chromosome ORDER BY total_genes DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

SELECT gene.chromosome, count(*) AS total_exons FROM gene JOIN transcript ON gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id JOIN exon_transcript ON transcript.transcript_id = exon_transcript.transcript_id WHERE gene.chromosome = 9;

Question 7:
-----------
