NORMALIZATION

UNF:
----
DB(pers_no, name, date_birth, lab_code, lab_name, research_code, research_descr, research_superv)

1NF:
----
DB(pers_no, name, date_birth, lab_code, lab_name)
researchref(pers_no, research_code)
research(research_code, research_descr, research_superv)

reseach code, description and supervisor are repeating fields so they should be put in a second table so that no group of columns respresents similar information. The DB table and research table have a many-to-many relationship, so a cross-reference table should be made.

2NF:
----
DB(pers_no, name, date_birth)
labref(pers_no, lab_code)
lab(lab_code, lab_name)
research(research_code, research_descr, research_superv)

all non-key columns should be dependent on the primary key (pers_no, research_code). This is not the case as lab_code and lab_name are not dependent on the personnel. The DB table and lab table have a many-to-many relatio,ship, so a cross-reference table should be made.

3NF:
----
= 2NF

all non-key columns should be non-transitively (directly) depenent on primary key. This is the case.
